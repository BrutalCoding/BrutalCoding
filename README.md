## Mr. Breedeveld
- Born & raised in '95 where my squinty eyes were mesmerized by the Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±.
- Worked for various startups since 2013.
- Don't ask me how to pronounce my surname in English, I'm struggling just as much as you.

## Connect
Look, I've found this website where I can dump all the programming languages and tools I have used in the past and have forgotten about.

Any idea which website? Wrong, it's not Pastebin. It's my [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/breedeveld/).

## Studies
- âœ… Completed VET in Software Engineering 2011 - 2015 @ Rotterdam Zadkine. Using languages such as HTML/CSS/JS/PHP, C# WinForm, C# Xamarin, UML diagrams, databases and more.
- âœ… Completed BSc in Software Engineering in 2015-2019 @ Rotterdam University. Using languages such as Python, TypeScript, R, F# and more importantly learning advanced concepts.

## Journey
- ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ During my BSc, I flew to China to do an internship at a company known in the open source drone community. Check out my [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojopL8bjvg0).
- ðŸ‘ª After my internship ended, I flew back as a dad. (oops)
- ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º After my BSc, I moved from NL to AU living with my new fam. Why AU? Long story.
- ðŸ’¼ Working for various start-ups again.

To this day, I'm still working on perfecting my Aussie accent. I'm about 1% there. I definitely recommend visiting Australiaâ€”just keep an eye out for those drop bears!
