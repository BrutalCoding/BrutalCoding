## Mr. Breedeveld
- Born & raised in '95 where my squinty eyes were mesmerized by the Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±.
- Worked for various startups since 2013.
- When things get crazy, I hear "Daniel Breedeveld". Don't ask me how to pronounce my surname in English, I'm struggling just as much as you.

## Find Me
Look, I've found this website where I can dump all the programming languages and tools I have used and have forgotten. But that's how you're supposed to complete your profile, right? It's on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/breedeveld/).

## Nerdy Studies
- âœ… Completed VET in Software Engineering 2011 - 2015 @ Rotterdam Zadkine. Using languages such as HTML/CSS/JS/PHP, C# WinForm, C# Xamarin, UML diagrams, databases and more.
- âœ… Completed BSc in Software Engineering in 2015-2019 @ Rotterdam University. Using languages such as Python, TypeScript, R, F# and more importantly learning advanced concepts.

## Recent Journey
- ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ During my BSc, I flew to China to do an internship at a company related to hexicopter drones. 
- ðŸ‘ª After my internship ended, I flew back as a dad.
- ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º After my BSc, I moved from NL to AU living with my new fam. Mind you, that's a flight to the opposite side of our planet. Without RedBull.
- ðŸ’¼ Working for various start-ups again.

To this day, I'm still trying to mimick being an aussie. Dropbears are real.
